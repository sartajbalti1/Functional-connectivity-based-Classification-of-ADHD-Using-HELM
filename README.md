# ADHD Classification Using Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation code for our research paper: "Functional Connectivity-based Classification of ADHD Using Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (HELM)."
## Dataset
The flod5data directory contains our preprocessed dataset divided into 5 folds for cross-validation experiments.
## Implementation
The repository includes several MATLAB scripts for HELM implementations with varying architectures:

HK_helm_train_1h.m: Implementation of kernel-based HELM with a single hidden layer
Additional scripts are provided for architectures with 2-4 layers
main2_k.m: Script for Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) experiments
main1_hk_1h.m: Script for Hierarchical Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (HKELM) experiments with one hidden layer

## Extending the Implementation
The codebase can be extended to implement deeper architectures by following the pattern established in the existing scripts.
